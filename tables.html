    <!--5.	Describe how the table was displayed. (What does the table look like according to you?):
    The table was displayed not in a usual way than I am used to for the table to be displayed with columns on top not like they are displayed on the side on this code. At first it look so confusing becausethe information based on each columnisvery close to each other, but when you observe more you become familiar and understand the information written on it. -->
